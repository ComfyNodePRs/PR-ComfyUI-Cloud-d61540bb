Don't have a GPU but want to run ComfyUI on your desktop? Do you enjoy ComfyUI running locally with full control, but just wished you could outsource the GPU power? Our plugin allows you to do just that! Execute your workflows on a local ComfyUI using our cloud GPUs. You only pay for the generation time.

**Perks:**
- No need to spend cash for a new GPU
- Don't have to bother with importing custom nodes/models into cloud providers
- Pay $0.003/s of image generation time! (e.g. your workflow takes 30 seconds to generate, your charge will be $0.09)

# Comfy Cloud Plugin Installation

> Plugin lets you execute workflows on a cloud GPU, even if your laptop does not have one.

1. `cd custom_nodes`
2. `git clone https://github.com/nathannlu/comfyui-cloud.git`
3. Run your workflow!

# How to use 
After you first install the plugin...
1. The first time you click 'generate', you will be prompted to log into your account.
2. Subsequent generations after the first is faster (the first run it takes a while to process your workflow).
Once those two steps have been completed, you will be able to seamlessly generate your workflow on the cloud!
